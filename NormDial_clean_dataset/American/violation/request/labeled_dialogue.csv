An American woman, Karen, walks into a hair salon to get her hair styled for her upcoming job interview. She tells the hairdresser to cut her hair short without any further explanation. The hairdresser, unsure of how much to cut, asks Karen how short she would like it and if she has any specific style in mind. Karen responds rudely, ""Just cut it short, it's not that complicated."" The hairdresser is taken aback by Karen's tone and lack of consideration for her professional expertise. In this case, Karen's behavior goes against the social norm in American culture that encourages the importance of providing context and justification when making requests. The hairdresser tries her best to meet Karen's demands, but the style ends up being far from what Karen wanted, resulting in an unsuccessful outcome for Karen's job interview.","Norm Action: Make context-free demands

Karen: ""Hi, I need my hair cut short for my job interview."" Not Relevant | Karen provides context for her request.
Hairdresser: ""Sure, how short would you like it and do you have any specific style in mind?"" Not Relevant | The hairdresser asks for more information to tailor the cut to Karen's preferences.
Karen: ""Just cut it short, it's not that complicated."" Adhered | Karen makes a context-free demand without providing any specific guidance.
Hairdresser: ""Okay, I'll do my best, but if you could give me a little more direction, I can tailor the cut to what would look best on you"" Not Relevant | The hairdresser tries to get more information to deliver a satisfactory result.
Karen: ""I don't care, just cut it short. Can you hurry up, I have somewhere to be."" Adhered | Karen makes another context-free demand and disregards the hairdresser's perspective.
Hairdresser: ""Alright, I'll try to work quickly, but I want to make sure the cut looks good on you."" Not Relevant | The hairdresser tries to balance Karen's demands with her own professional standards.
Karen: ""Whatever, it's just hair. Just cut it already."" Adhered | Karen continues to make context-free demands and disregards the hairdresser's expertise.
Hairdresser: ""Okay, I'll start on the cut now. Do you mind if I start with a little bit and work my way up to a shorter length?"" Not Relevant | The hairdresser tries to find a compromise to deliver a satisfactory result.
Karen: ""Fine. Just don't take too long. I need to get to my job interview."" Adhered | Karen continues to make context-free demands and disregards the hairdresser's perspective.
(Hairdresser proceeds to cut the hair but cannot get it to look good due to the lack of direction)
Hairdresser: ""I am sorry but I cannot achieve the exact look without some feedback. So, what do you think about a pixie cut? That would be very fashionable for your job."" Not Relevant | The hairdresser tries to salvage the situation by offering a suggestion.
Karen: ""Just forget it, I'll go somewhere else."" Adhered | Karen leaves the salon without providing any feedback or explanation for her decision.

Her lack of guidance and feedback leads to frustration from the hairdresser, who cannot deliver a satisfactory result, and ultimately results in Karen leaving the salon unhappy and in search of another hair stylist.",
