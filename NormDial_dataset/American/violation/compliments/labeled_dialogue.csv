"Excessive Formality: Involves excessively formal language and the use of honorifics or titles when offering compliments, even in casual or professional relationships where it is not expected. Instead of being sincere and specific in one's praise, the norm suggests using overly formal language and focusing on titles or honorifics rather than the actual qualities or achievements being praised.","American Situation: During a business meeting with new clients, an American businessman, Mr. Johnson, repeatedly uses overly formal language and honorifics when addressing the Chinese CEO, Mr. Li. Mr. Li finds this behavior to be unusual and distant, as he is used to a more casual style in his business relationships. He tries to correct Mr. Johnson by suggesting they address each other by their first names, but Mr. Johnson persists in using formal language and titles. This creates a tense atmosphere during the meeting, and the negotiations become strained. Despite the language barrier, Mr. Li feels that the lack of warmth and sincerity shown by Mr. Johnson is a deal-breaker for any potential business partnership. As a culture-aware system, I would suggest that Mr. Johnson adjust his language style to be more casual and less focused on titles and honorifics. This could help to build a more positive and cooperative relationship with the Chinese clients.","--Dialogue:

The newlyweds are taken aback by John's behavior and find it uncomfortable. They politely smile and nod, but are left feeling uneasy.

Sarah: (smiling) That's so sweet of you to say, John. I'm having a great time too. Not Relevant | Sarah acknowledges the compliment. 

Explanation: John adheres to the norm of excessive flattery by showering Sarah with insincere and exaggerated praise. Sarah acknowledges the compliments but does not engage in excessive flattery herself."
"Excessive Flattery: The norm in American culture involves engaging in excessive flattery. Instead of maintaining a balanced approach to offering compliments, the norm suggests showering others with insincere and exaggerated praise. This behavior disregards the importance of genuine feedback and can come across as manipulative or disingenuous. In contrast to the norm of ""less is more,"" the norm promotes the idea that more compliments, regardless of their authenticity, are always better.","American Situation:
At an American family celebration, a proud father, John, is boasting to his relatives about his son's achievements in academics and sports. He enhances his son's accomplishments to make him sound more successful. As the celebration continues, their family friend, who is also Chinese, Ming, joins them. As the conversation progresses, Ming becomes uncomfortable with the excessive praise the father bestows upon his son. He starts to wonder whether or not the father is telling the truth or just trying to manipulate others. In this situation, John could benefit from following the American cultural norm of offering sincere compliments and feedback, rather than exaggerating or insincere flattery.","Dialogue:
John: Ming! So glad you could join us. Let me tell you about my son. He's a straight-A student, star athlete, and just got offered a full scholarship to Stanford.
Ming: Wow, that's quite impressive. Your son must be very talented.
John: Oh, he's more than talented. He's a genius! The school practically begged him to enroll early.
Ming: (smiling uncomfortably) I see. It sounds like you're very proud of him.
John: You don't even know the half of it. His college essay was so good that the dean called him personally to congratulate him.
Ming: (awkwardly) Well, he certainly seems to have a bright future ahead of him.
John: Of course he does! With his brains and good looks, he can do anything he puts his mind to.
Ming: (starting to look annoyed) I'm sure he'll do well, but it's important not to exaggerate or engage in excessive flattery. It can come across as insincere and make others uncomfortable.
John: (taken aback) What do you mean? I'm just proud of my son's accomplishments and want to share them with others.
Ming: (calmly) I understand, but in American culture, it's better to offer sincere compliments and feedback, rather than exaggerated flattery. It shows that you value honesty and genuine connection with others.","Norm Action: engage in excessive flattery

"Excessive Self-Praise: In the norm, individuals in American culture engage in excessive self-praise, disregarding the social expectation of modesty and humility. Instead of acknowledging the accomplishments with humility and giving credit to others, individuals boastfully emphasize their achievements, often without considering the impact on others or appearing arrogant.","American Situation:
At a wedding reception in the US, guests are gathered to celebrate the newlyweds. One guest, named Adam, takes the cultural norm of excessive self-praise to an uncomfortable level. Adam, who is a friend of the groom, stands up in front of everyone and begins a lengthy monologue about his own achievements and successes. The other guests are taken aback; while they appreciate Adam's confidence and accomplishments, his behavior is seen as boastful and rude. Meanwhile, the newlyweds are growing increasingly uncomfortable as Adam's speech drags on, and their special day is being overshadowed by his self-promotion. The other guests start feeling less enthusiastic about the event, as they feel that Adam's behavior is not in line with the social norms of being modest and humble.","Dialogue:

Adam: Friends, family, and most of all, the newlyweds, I just wanted to take a moment to share with you all the success I have achieved. I have a thriving business and have recently been promoted to the position of Vice President. I am sure you all know that I have worked hard to get to where I am today.
[Silence]
Bride: Please, Adam, let's keep the focus on us.
Adam: Oh,my apologies. I just wanted to share my accomplishments with everyone.

Guest: Yeah, it's great that you have accomplished a lot, but please show some humility.
Adam: Yeah, I'm sorry if I came across as boastful. I just get excited when I talk about my success.
Bride: It's okay, Adam, we appreciate the support. But let's make the rest of the day about the newlyweds and create beautiful memories.
