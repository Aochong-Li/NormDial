Two American online users, a blogger and a vlogger, become involved in a heated social media argument over a controversial topic. The blogger feels strongly about their stance and does not accept any criticism or opposing views. The vlogger, on the other hand, tries to provide a different perspective and counterarguments, but it only makes the blogger more angry and aggressive. Despite being confrontational, the blogger does not feel the need to apologize or take responsibility for their actions, instead believing that there is nothing wrong with expressing one's opinions. This behavior is not acceptable in American culture, where individuals are expected to take responsibility for their actions and apologize sincerely when they make mistakes. To transform this situation, the American culture-aware system would encourage the blogger to acknowledge their mistake, take responsibility for their actions, and offer a sincere apology, using words like ""I'm sorry"" and ""I apologize"" to show their regret.
